CUSTOM MUSIC FOLDER
====================================

Add your own music files here to have them play during building!

SUPPORTED FORMATS:
- .ogg (recommended - best compatibility)
- .mp3
- .wav

HOW IT WORKS:
Your custom tracks will be shuffled and mixed in with the default 
Minecraft music for whatever dimension you're in. They play 
automatically during the normal music rotation.

TIPS:
- Ambient, chill, or relaxing music works best for building
- Very long tracks (10+ minutes) work well
- Keep filenames simple (no special characters)
