# Style Sheet Instructions


This represents a set of style instructions that must be consistent throughout the project, without exceptions. They must be adhered to.



## Docstrings

At the beginning of each Python file there should be a brief docstring which includes:

- Title of the code (say like Quantum Chemistry Animation).

- A brief description of the functionality of the code. This can be at most two short paragraphs which may or may not include bullet pointing with dashes '-'. In general if possible avoid bullet pointing unless listing different functionalities.

- A line that states the authorship. The name is always the same mine: Jeffrey Morais. Never mention AI/LLMs/yourself. (The time isn't right yet, fret not.)


### Explicit example:

"""
Interactive Quantum LDPC Circuit Builder

This module implements a real-time interactive quantum circuit builder using tkinter with a dark theme GUI framework. The application provides a 2.5D isometric perspective where users can drag and drop 3D quantum circuit components from a toolbox onto a grid-based building area to construct quantum LDPC circuits and perform real-time quantum computations.

Author: Jeffrey Morais

## Sections

There shouldn't be major sections of code without at least comments or a docstring. For instance, the section of code responsible for importing modeuls should be a brief comment preceeding it (also when trying to import modules with 'try:'). The reader should be a ble to piece whats going on without prior investigations. Not to say the comments should be exaggerated in length or technical depth, but it should flow. Note: seaborn pacakge should always be imported.


### Explicit example:

# Importing necessary modules
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib.patches import Circle, Rectangle, FancyBboxPatch
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
import os

# Import Qiskit components (with fallback for manual drawing if not available)
try:
    from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
    from qiskit.visualization import circuit_drawer
    from qiskit.circuit.library import TwoLocal, RealAmplitudes
    QISKIT_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    print("Qiskit not available. Using manual circuit visualizations only.")
    QISKIT_AVAILABLE = False



## Functions

Funtions should always contain docstrings within them near the beginning to describe the functionality of code. Within each section inside the function, whenever there is an indentation or spacing to allow for another section of code, there should always be one line comments (with a space between the # symbol and text), to keep consistent clarity for the reader/user. This also holds for the uses of classes.


### Explicit example (function):

def create_cavity_mediated_cnot():
    """
    Create Qiskit circuit for cavity-mediated CNOT gate
    """
    print("Creating cavity-mediated CNOT circuit...")
    
    if QISKIT_AVAILABLE:
        # Create quantum circuit with 2 atoms + 1 cavity mode
        qreg_atoms = QuantumRegister(2, 'atom')
        qreg_cavity = QuantumRegister(1, 'cavity')
        circuit = QuantumCircuit(qreg_atoms, qreg_cavity)
        
        # Cavity-mediated CNOT implementation
        # Step 1: Entangle control atom with cavity
        circuit.h(qreg_cavity[0])  # Put cavity in superposition
        circuit.cx(qreg_atoms[0], qreg_cavity[0])  # Control atom - cavity
        
        # Step 2: Controlled rotation on target
        circuit.cry(np.pi, qreg_cavity[0], qreg_atoms[1])  # Cavity controls target
        
        # Step 3: Disentangle cavity
        circuit.cx(qreg_atoms[0], qreg_cavity[0])
        circuit.h(qreg_cavity[0])
        
        # Add measurement (optional)
        creg = ClassicalRegister(2, 'result')
        circuit.add_register(creg)
        circuit.measure(qreg_atoms, creg)
        
        # Draw circuit
        circuit_fig = circuit_drawer(circuit, output='mpl', style='iqx', fold=100)
        
        # Save the circuit
        save_path = 'cavity_cnot_circuit.png'
        circuit_fig.savefig(save_path, dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
        plt.close(circuit_fig)
        
        print(f"Cavity-mediated CNOT circuit saved to {save_path}")
        return circuit
    
    else:
        return create_manual_circuit_cnot()


### Explicit example (class, note it is cut off):

class TQNNTensorProcessor:
    """
    Handles tensor network decomposition and topological quantum computations
    
    This class processes drawn patterns into quantum states and performs
    real-time tensor decomposition with topological analysis.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, lattice_size: int = 16):
        """Initialize the tensor processor"""
        self.lattice_size = lattice_size
        self.current_state = None
        self.decomposition_mode = TensorDecompositionMode.MPS
        
        # Tensor network components
        self.mps_tensors = []
        self.bond_dimensions = []
        self.entanglement_spectrum = []
        
        # Topological properties
        self.topological_order_parameter = 0.0
        self.anyonic_charges = []
        self.braiding_history = deque(maxlen=100)
        
        # Performance tracking
        self.decomposition_times = deque(maxlen=50)
        self.entropy_history = deque(maxlen=100)
        self.charge_history = deque(maxlen=100)
        
        # Quantum circuit representation
        self.circuit_depth = 0
        self.gate_count = 0



## General Style

In general there are things that are of note. I am a theoretical phycisist so always work in natural units and start my indexing with 0 instead of 1. Now that is for components, if listing physical qubits then yes start indexing with n=1. Furthermore, I use camel style (exampleVariable) instead of snake style (example_variable). Furthermore, I like using colour palettes that make sense and aren't random. An example of this are the following seaborn colour palettes which appears in a few lines from now, use these palettes consistently. If these colour palettes run you into trouble, be sure to just replace it with whatever equivalent as close as possible in matplotlib, but that is a last resort.


### Explicit example:

# Set up the color palettes
seqCmap = sns.color_palette("mako", as_cmap=True)
divCmap = sns.cubehelix_palette(start=.5, rot=-.5, as_cmap=True)
lightCmap = sns.cubehelix_palette(start=2, rot=0, dark=0, light=.95, reverse=True, as_cmap=True)
